            <p><strong>Why</strong></p>
            <p>
                L.U.C.Y exists to address the suffering endured by animals who lack the power to control their lives. 
                Neglect, cruelty, and ignorance combine to create a hostile environment for many creatures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nepal is a country where street animals often suffer due to lack of care and misinformation. Our goal is to 
                reduce suffering by providing medical care, promoting adoption, conducting vaccination programs, and spreading 
                awareness about animal rights.

            <h2>Our Mission in Nepal</h2>
            <p>
                After years of political instability and the devastating 2015 earthquake, Nepal faces numerous challenges. 
                Animal welfare remains a low priority, but L.U.C.Y is dedicated to creating change. Established to improve 
                the welfare of street animals, our work spans rescuing, rehabilitating, and providing support to animals across the country.

                        As Nepal's capital, Kathmandu is central to our operations. We work with local municipalities to 
                        provide animal control, rescue services, and medical care for street animals. Our team is dedicated 
                        to responding quickly and efficiently to calls for help.

                        Known for its scenic beauty, Pokhara is home to many stray animals in need of care. L.U.C.Y’s team 
                        in Pokhara focuses on vaccinations, adoption drives, and reducing the population of stray animals 
                        humanely through spay and neuter programs.
